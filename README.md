# ALX Low Level Programming

This repo contains C programming Language tasks.

# Why C ?

Well C is a great programming language that has been existing for so long now, it is a low level language (ie) it is very close to the machine. Learning C gives us the power to build almost anything, we have control over the computer memory and all, C lays a foundation on which other programming languages like Python C++ were built.

# Limitations

One of the limitations of C programming language is that it is not object oriented unlike the modern languages. That's why C++ was built.
